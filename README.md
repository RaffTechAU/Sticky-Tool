# Sticky-Tool
![Sticky-Tool icon](https://github.com/nightleyxx/Sticky-Tool/blob/main/Icon/OIG.ico?raw=true)

This is a command-line tool written in C# that replaces the sticky keys executable with any executable of your choice.
The application is very simple with only two arguments:
* '--file' <file path> allows you to tell Sticky-Tool what program you want to replace the sticky keys prompt<br>
  (e.g. sticky-tool.exe --file "C:\users\nightley\test.exe)
* '--restore' removes the modified sticky keys executable and restores the original prompt

This is a simple command-line tool that is also in its infancy. Please report any bugs found.
